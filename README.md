# Learn C++

I am following [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) which has proven to be a thorough and easy to understand resource for learning C++!

## IDE Setup

These instructions are for C++20 with VSCode on Ubuntu 22.04.

VSCode run configuration goes in the tasks.json file. See [here](tasks.json.txt) for example tasks file.

Configure VSCode intellisense to use C++20. Steps:
- Search 'C_Cpp.default.cpp' in preferences, settings
- Set dropdown to C++20
